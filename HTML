		<main><p1><a name="Ac"></a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>These ones were all designed to work with the PS2, but most all of these will work with newer consoles with either the right modifications, or the proper adapters.</p1>
		<br><br>
		<p2><Center>Gibson SG</Center><img alt="Gibson SG red, white, and black variants" class="images" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/666da957cea70e6ce2c62bcd/1718478069263-T5AGJDXT86KW3HN0831W/sgs-combined.png?format=2500w">
		The Gibson SG controller, is based on the Gibson SG. Duh. This is one of the, if not THE first every guitar hero controller produced. These ons are originally wired and designed to work only with the PS2. The Gibson SG and any other guitar I do not specify otherwise on here is in around 3:5 scale compared to the real guitar. This only applies to 1st party guitars, and not 3rd party, and some guitars mught be slighty more or less than 3:5. I have one of these.
		<br><br><br><center>Mayflash<br><img class="images2" src="https://img.leboncoin.fr/api/v1/lbcpb1/images/37/37/a9/3737a971a739a93be04704f73c59df56e75e3183.jpg?rule=ad-large"></center>
		The Mayflash is basically a wireless version of the SG, but is however seemengly not directly based on any one real guitar. I have one of these too.
		<br><br><br><Center>Shredder</Center>
		<center> <img class="images2" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RfI+Rb2YL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg"></center>
		Works the same as the SG pretty much, but in a different style design wise. This one seems to be pretty common. I see it everywhere.
		<br><br><br><Center>Flying V, Freedom V, etc.</Center>
		<img class="images" src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/LcIAAOSwpzhggdJl/s-l1200.jpg">
		A V style guitar that goes by a few different names. Function wise works pretty much the same as the Mayflash.
		<br><br><br><Center>Kramer</Center>
		<img class="images" src="https://www.jnlgame.com/cdn/shop/products/image_6e1df676-3491-4ff9-bebd-10d1952fa3a8.jpg?v=1678164988">
		The Kramer is a unique guitar style wise because it's similar to the Strat, but in an earlier style. Works like the rest so far.</p2>
	<div>
		<br><br><p3><a name="A"></a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>These next ones are the non-replica/non-full-scale designed work with either both the PS2 and PS3, just the PS3, Xbox 360, or the Wii. Any guitar designed to work with the PS3 that isn't a MIDI or pro controller should work with the PS4 and PS5 as well.</p3>
		<br><br>
		<p4>
		<center>Guitar Hero 4-World Tour Guitar</center>
		<img class="images" src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/8NMAAOSwiQpkRiBr/s-l1200.jpg">
		One of the first ones to have the main color be a sunburst style. This is also the first one to have the touch strip below the buttons. This one has versions for the Wii, PS2, PS3, and Xbox 360.
		<br><br><br><center>X-plorer</center>
		<img class="images" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/productimage/74-117-023-02.jpg">
		Designed primarily to work with the Xbox 360, this one has a design similar to the older guitars designed for the PS2. It's based of the Gibson X-plorer.
		<br><br><br><center>Aerosmith Guitar</center>
		<img class="images" src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/HJ8AAOSw9S5lOqPf/s-l1200.jpg">
		This one is based on the Gibson Les Paul, a guitar this is considered one of the absolute best is terms of real guitars. I persoanlly prefer to feel of a Strat controller wise. There are variants designed to work with the PS2, PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360.
		<br><br><br><center>GH6 - Warriors of Rock Guitar</center>
		<img class="images1" src="https://wiki.clonehero.net/uploads/images/gallery/2023-05/warriors-of-rock-combined.png">
		This one is rather special and unique. It has variants for the PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360. What makes this one special is the wings. They can be removed, and replaced with either the axe wings or a custom 3D printed set.
		<br><br><br><center>Gibson Les Paul</center>
		<img class="images" src="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IPPo4kMFIcINmmdB.large">
		It's based on the Les Paul, and has variants for the PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii. These ones often have an issue where some of the fret buttons don't work well due to poor design choices causing loose connection. Based on my experience with the one I have for the Xbox 360, simply putting a small square peice of cardboard inside where the neck attaches on the side away from the connection completely fixes this issue.
		<br><br><br><center>Guitar Hero 5 guitar</center>
		<img class="images" src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/HcUAAOSw-LJbdDlX/s-l1200.jpg">
		Has variants for the PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360. The PS3 variant will alsow work with the PS2 vis the USB ports. Doesn't seem to have any specific real guitar example, but it's similar to the Strat.
		<br><br><br><center>Fender™ Stratocaster™</center>
		<img class="images3" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JYZKQSa-L.jpg">

		<img class="images1" src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/JkcAAOSwRrpi4Ij9/s-l1200.jpg">
		As shown, there are several different color and pattern variants for this wonderful controller. I personally find this to be my favorite along with the riffmaster. The Strat was the first true rock band guitar. It has variants(not color, just technology) for the PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Wii. The PS4 and PS3 one will also work with the PS5. I have a wireless and a wired one for the Xbox 360. They both work, but they're just the plain black and white ones.
		<br><br><br><center>Hofner Bass</center>
		<img class="images" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L9RkJf7EL.jpg">
		One of the instruments released for the Beatles rock band game, this is one of the few controllers actually based on a bass, instead of an eletric guitar. Any guitar can be used to play bass in the games, and the bass controllers can be used to play guitar. But it's fun to switch back and forth anyway. This one has variants for the Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii. This one might work on the PS2.
		<br><br><br><center>Rickenbacker Guitar</center>
		<img class="images" src="https://now.estarland.com/images/products/65/34265/129354.jpg">
		Another one released with the Beatles game, based of a Rickenbacker eletric guitar. Compatibility wise, this one should be the same as the Hofner Bass and the Gretsch Duo Jet.
		<br><br><br><center>Gretsch Duo Jet Guitar</center>
		<img class="images" src="https://image.konsolenkost.de/item/images/1035646/full/ps3-gretsch-duo-jet-controller-gitarre-guitar-rock-band-beatles-c.jpg">
		Based of the real Gretsch Duo Jet Guitar. Again, going as far as Compatibility it should be the same as the other 2 released for the Beatles rock band game.

		<br><br><p03><a name="B"></a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>And now for the Guitars designed for the PS4 and PS5. These can work on previous consoles with proper adapters. Keep in mind pretty much and older guitar with the proper modificatins or adapters should also work on the PS4 and the PS5.</p03>
		<br><br>
		<p5>
		<center>Fender Jaguar</center>
		<img class="images1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TzLEkjUJL.jpg">
		The Jaguar has variants for the PS4, PS5, and Xbox One. It comes in a couple different colors, I know at least theres the red version shown here and a blue version.
		<br><br><br><center>Riffmaster</center>
		<img class="images1" src="https://pisces.bbystatic.com/image2/BestBuy_US/images/products/6579/6579283cv15d.jpg">
		What is as far as I am aware, the newest controller out there. The riffmaster has versions for the PS4/PS5 and Xbox One. This guitar is special because it jas a joystick on the back where the head and neck meet. The neck on the riffmaster can be holded back for storage too. This one had 2 special editions, which featured a special faceplate. One was a pre-order special thing, and the other was bought in a pack, which was a Metallica theme.

	<div>
		<br><br><p04><a name="C"></a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>And now for some truly special controllers. These ones are some of the more rare ones, the ones you see selling anywhere from $100 to $500. A lot of these are made of real wood, and don't worry, I'll make sure to point out which ones I know are. Also note that some of these are either 2nd or 3rd party.</p04>
		<br><br>
		<p6>
		<center>Peak Guitar Controller</center>
		<img class="images1" src="https://www.go-peak.com/images/peak-guitar.jpg">
		This one is one of the, if not the first ever released full scale guitar controller made with real wood. This Guitar seems to be based on the Strat. Either way it's considered a collectors item, as are most all of the controllers in this section. It was for either the PS2 or PS3.
		<br><br><br><center>Fender Precision Bass</center>
		<img class="images" src="https://www.guitar-hero.ch/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rb2_bass_white.jpg">
		The only other Bass controller aside from the Hofner that I am aware of. This one features a dual strumbar so it can be played like an actual bass. I'm not sure whether this is made out of real wood or not, but it is a full-scale replica. It is officialy licensed by Fender, and produced by Madcatz.
